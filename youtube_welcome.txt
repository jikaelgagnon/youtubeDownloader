Before starting, here is some important information:

There are four download formats:
- Video
- Audio
- Audio and Video (Split)
- Audio and Video (Combined)

Downloading both combined can be practical, but it limits the video quality to
a maximum of 720p. If you seek higher quality you can use external programs to merge 
audio and video.

To fully close the program, press on the 'QUIT' button at the bottom of the screen; the 
'X' button in the top corner is not sufficient.


Once you're ready to go, click on the start button below!
